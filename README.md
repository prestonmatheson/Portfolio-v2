## TODOS:
- implement an open flow home, about me, and contact page.
- create a seperate template for blog and portfolio.
- nav bar should be fixed and follow user down as they scroll
- blog posts/portfolio items should only be able to be created/edited by an AdminUser
- blog posts should have topic pages displayed instead of the actual posts(except the most recent post)
- Daily reminders should be sent to create a new blog post via twillio
- portfolios should have drag and drop effect but only for the AdminUser
